        <h2>Study has ended â€“ Thanks!</h2>
          <p>
          Our research project <a href="https://empri-devops.de">EMPRI-DEVOPS</a> ended in July 2022 and with it our GitHub Timestamp Study.
          <strong>Thanks very much for taking part!</strong>
          Unfortunately, we managed to receive only very little usage data.
          For that reason, we cannot show you any results at this point.
          </p>

          For the time being, this extension will <em>no longer collect or submit data</em> for our study.
          You can still view and export previously collected data in the settings.
